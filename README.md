## What is this?

This is a GUI made for the command line program hashcat. This application is not designed to take full advantage of the hashcat program, it's purely for cracking hashes in as simple manner as possible.

## Why did I make this?

When I was using hashcat for one of my Cybersecurity labs, I felt that the command line arguments didn't make much sense when I was attempting to crack hashes for that lab. So, I turned to my knowledge of Python in order to make a GUI for hashcat, to make using the application as easy as possible. The end result is a clean but functional UI that gives the necessary information to the user to crack hashes of their own.
